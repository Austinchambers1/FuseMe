# FuseMe
FuseMe takes a snippet of music and fuses it with your voice using cross synthesis. An EECS 352 Project by  [Austin Chambers](https://github.com/Austinchambers1), [Junhao Li](https://github.com/JunhaoSLi) and [Eric Hao](https://github.com/brotatotes)

# [Try it out!](https://fuseme.herokuapp.com/)
FuseMe was built using python in Flask. Not surprisingly for a webapp, the front end uses HTML and CSS to display the pages. Key python libraries used are librosa, numpy, and scipy. Plots were generated with matplotlib. The Flask application is hosted on Heroku.
